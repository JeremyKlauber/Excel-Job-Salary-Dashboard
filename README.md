Excel for Data Analytics – Course Project

1. Objective

This dashboard was developed as a practical project completed as part of Excel for Data Analytics – Full Course for Beginners by Luke Barousse. The objective was to apply foundational data analysis techniques in Excel to transform raw data into an interactive dashboard that supports exploratory analysis and simple decision-making.

2. Learning Context

The project followed a guided, hands-on workflow taught in the course, focusing on best practices for entry-level data analysts, including structured data preparation, logical modelling, and clear dashboard design.

3. Data Preparation

The dataset was first reviewed and prepared to ensure it was suitable for analysis:

Raw data was organised into structured tables.

Inconsistent or missing values were checked and corrected where required.

Categorical fields were standardised to support filtering and aggregation.

Data validation was applied to maintain accuracy and consistency.

These steps ensured the data was clean, reliable, and ready for analysis.

4. Analysis and Calculations

Key metrics were generated using Excel formulas and structured references:

Calculated fields were created to support comparisons and summaries.

Aggregations such as averages and totals were derived dynamically.

Supporting tables were used to drive filters and slicers.

This approach allowed the dashboard to update automatically based on user selections.

5. Dashboard Construction

The dashboard was designed to prioritise clarity and usability:

Logical separation between data, calculations, and presentation.

Interactive filters to allow users to explore the data by category.

Clear summary outputs to highlight key insights.

A clean layout to minimise visual clutter and improve readability.

The design follows standard principles for entry-level analytical dashboards.

6. Outcome

The completed dashboard demonstrates practical Excel skills relevant to junior data analyst roles, including data cleaning, basic analysis, and dashboard development. It reflects an understanding of how to translate raw data into an accessible analytical tool using Excel.
